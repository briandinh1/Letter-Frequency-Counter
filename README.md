# Letter-Frequency-Counter
A lot of my projects read in frequencies of characters / words a lot, so I made this little helper program  
It reads in a text file and outputs character frequencies in order in an output named frequencies.txt to be used elsewhere

Can easily change the frequency from characters to words with a few line swaps in the code
